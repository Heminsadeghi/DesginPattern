The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing objects. 

In other words, the Prototype pattern allows you to create new objects from existing ones by cloning them without specifying the exact class of the objects.

The Prototype pattern is useful when you need to create new objects that are similar to existing ones but with some differences in their state or behavior.

The Prototype pattern is also helpful for creating a new object that is complex and may incur overhead. 
So you want to avoid the complexity and the overhead by cloning an existing object instead of creating a new one from scratch.



The Prototype pattern involves the following participants:

Prototype: 
      The Prototype can be an interface or an abstract class. The Prototype interface (or abstract class) has the Clone() method 
      that creates a new object from an existing object.

ConcretePrototype: 
      This is a concrete class of the Prototype interface. The ConcretePrototype class implements the Clone() method for cloning an object.

Client: 
     This is the client code that uses the Prototype interface for creating new objects. 
The client creates a new object by cloning an existing object and then customizes the cloned object as needed.
