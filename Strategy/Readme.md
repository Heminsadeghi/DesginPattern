The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.

Usage examples: The Observer pattern is pretty common in C# code, especially in the GUI components. 
It provides a way to react to events happening in other objects without coupling to their classes.

Identification: The pattern can be recognized by subscription methods, 
that store objects in a list and by calls to the update method issued to objects in that list.

---
The Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
